Running mixed SystemC-OMNeT++ simulations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OMNEST makes it possible to run simulations that mix SystemC and OMNEST
models. SystemC is a system specification and simulation library
from the Open SystemC Initiative, www.systemc.org.

SystemC itself comes as a C++ library. SystemC models are C++ code, and as
such, SystemC models can be linked into OMNEST simulations. Because both
OMNEST modules and SystemC modules are C++ objects, they can communicate
via C++ method calls. Ordered execution of SystemC and OMNEST events is
ensured by a custom OMNEST scheduler.

Using the solution described here, SystemC and OMNEST modules will be part
of the same program, and will execute in the same process. This usually
results in orders of magnitude higher simulation speeds than distributed
solutions like co-simulation or HLA, and also allows simpler and more fine-
grained communication between modules.

We provide example simulations which demonstrate the use of the SystemC
modules, and may serve as a starting point for the customer's new
simulations.
